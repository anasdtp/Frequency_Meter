A high accuracy frequency meter using ESP32,
measuring up to 40 MHz. Very stable. Optionally, you can test the frequency meter with internal oscillator.
Caution = input signal to Freq Meter - only 3.3 Volts! If you want 5 Volts, use level converter.

Definitions:

GPIO_34 = Freq Meter Input
GPIO_33 = Oscillator output - to test Frequency Meter
To test freq Meter with internal oscillator, make connection between GIPO_34 and GPIO_33 (optional).
Change frequency, inputting value at Arduino console (1 Hz to 40 MHz)

The frequency meter is divided into 5 parts:
1. Pulse counter;
2. Counting time control;
3. Printing the result;
4. Space for other functions.
5. Signal programmed Oscillator

1. The pulse counter uses the ESP32 pcnt.
Pcnt has the following parameters:
a. input port;
b. input channel;
c. control port;
d. count on Pulse raising;
e. count on Pulse falling;
f. counting only with Control - high level;
g. maximum count limit.

2. Counting time control uses the high resolution esp-timer:
The esp-timer has the following parameter:
a. time control;

5. Frequency Oscillator for tests, uses ledc peripheral:
The ledc has the following parameters:
a. output port;
B. lcd channel;
รง. frequency;
d. resolution of ledc;
e. duty cycle at 50%;

Operation:

The high level of control port enable the counter to count the pulses that arrive at the input port.
Pulses are counted both as the pulse rising and falling, to improve the counting average.
The sampling time is defined by the high resolution esp-timer, and it is defined in 1 second, in the sample-time variable.
If the count is greater than 20000 pulses during the counting time, overflow occurs and for with each overflow that occurs
the multPulses variable is incremented. Then pulse counter is cleared and proceed to counting.
Unfortunately the Pulse Counter has only 16 bits that may be used.

When the sampling time ends, a routine is called and the value in the pulse counter is read and saved.
A flag is set on to indicating that the pulse reading has ended.

In the loop, when verifying if the flag is on indicates that the pulse reading has finished, the value is calculated by multiplying
the number of overflow by 20000 and adding to the number of remaining pulses and dividing by 2, because it counted 2 times.

As the pulses are counted on the way up and down, the count is double the frequency.
In the frequency value, commas are inserted and printed on the serial monitor.
The registers are reset and the input control port is set to a high level again and the pulse count starts.

It also has a signal oscillator that generates pulses, and can be used for testing.
This oscillator can be configured to generate frequencies up to 40 MHz.
We use the LEDC peripheral of ESP32 to generate frequency that can be used as a test.
The base frequency value is 12543 Hz, but it can be typed to another value on the serial monitor.
The default duty cycle was set to 50%, and the resolution is properly calculated.
The output port of this generator is currently defined as GPIO 33.

Internally using GPIO matrix, the input pulse was directed to the ESP32 native LED,
so the LED will flash at the input frequency.
